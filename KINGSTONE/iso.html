<h2><u>QUALITY PROCESS</u></h2>
<p>In pursuit of clinical excellence and quality healthcare services, The Kingston Hospital has embraced Quality Improvement Principles and put forth a team of dedicated staff to facilitate the process and to bring on board all staff in the achievement, practice and sustain certification in Food Safety Management, Quality Management and Environmental Management. Our mark of distinction as a healthcare institution is CONSISTENCY. Quality Service shall be provided to all our clients; with respect and dignity, and at all times, making sure that each clientâ€™s need is uniquely met, and exceeded.</p>
<p>The Kingston Hospital has demonstrated commitment to these ideals. Three certifications have been issued to the Hospital:</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> <u><b>ISO 9001:2008    Quality Management System</b></u></li>
<p>    The Kingston Hospital shall endeavor to consistently provide quality healthcare services by efficiently combining cutting-edge technology with qualified staff and streamlined processes to all its clients. A good example of this commitment is that a client shall notice a change in the staff serving him/her and not the quality of service during each shift change.</p>
<li>     <b><u>ISO 22000:2005  Food Safety Management System</u></b></li>
<p>Through process audits, staff training, investment in technology and nutritional values, The Kingston Hospital shall provide all its clients with quality food; from breakfast to supper and everything in between. These meals shall be served at acceptable temperatures and with decent expedient service.</p>
<li>    <b><u> ISO 14001:2004  Environmental Management System</u></b></li>
<p>The Kingston Hospitalis committed to the conservation of natural resources and shall as such carry out its duties responsibly, careful use of energy and water, and participate in activities that are geared towards conserving the environment; locally, nationally and regionally. Examples of these activities locally and nationally include cleanup exercises along Ngong Road, Ralph Blunche Road and Argwings Kodhek Road and tree planting and maintenance at the Nairobi National Park under the Greenline Project.</p>
