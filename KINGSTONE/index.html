<b><p>Improving our patients’ experience – invitation to our ‘In our shoes’ sessions</p></b>
<p>At Kingston Hospital NHS Trust our ambition is for all of our patients to experience care that is safe, compassionate and of the highest quality. As a part of this we are building on work we have done so far to improve our patients’ experience, by listening to the actual experiences and views of our patients. </p>
<p>We would like to hear your views about what was good about the care you or your loved one received and what you feel needs improving.</p>
<p>To do this, we are running a series of <i>“In Your Shoes”</i> events in November 2011. Each workshop will last around 2 hours. Patients who attend will be able to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>share your recent experiences in our care, one-to-one with a member of the hospital team, letting them know what it was like ‘in your shoes’</li>
    <li>discuss what went well, as well as what needs improving</li>
    <li>share your ideas and listen to other people’s views in group discussions</li>
    <li>help us shape our vision for the standards of care all our staff will live up to</li>
   
</ul>
